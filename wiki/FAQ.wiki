  # How can I open my file type with Transalyzer?

If your data is stored in a file type other than those currently supported, you must modify the fun_load_trace_file function in GUI_detect. Add a new case at the end of the switch statement:

{{{
        % get the trace file type
        file_type = get(handles.pop_file_type,'Value');
                
        switch  file_type % switch based on type of trace
                    
             case # % add a new case after last case statement
}}}

Your code may use two inputs:
    # filename - complete path to trace file
    # currentsegment - which segment of the trace to open

And generate the following vectors and variables:
    # handles.file_load_successful - file opened correctly 1, or not 0
    # handles.trace - current values of the trace in nA
    # handles.time_vector - timepoints for each current point
    # handles.timestep - time between each current point
    # handles.total_number_of_segments - total number of segments in this trace
