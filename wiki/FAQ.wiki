  # ==How can I open my file type with Transalyzer?==

If your data is stored in a file type other than those currently supported, you must modify the fun_load_trace_file function in GUI_detect. Add a new case at the end of the switch statement:

{{{
        % get the trace file type
        file_type = get(handles.pop_file_type,'Value');
                
        switch  file_type % switch based on type of trace
                    
             case # % add a new case after last case statement
}}}

Your code may use two inputs:
    # filename - complete path to trace file
    # currentsegment - which segment of the trace to open

And generate the following vectors and variables:
    # handles.file_load_successful - file opened correctly 1, or not 0
    # handles.trace - current values of the trace in nA
    # handles.time_vector - timepoints for each current point
    # handles.timestep - time between each current point
    # handles.total_number_of_segments - total number of segments in this trace

  # ==How do I diagnose a programming issue?==

In Matlab data is typically stored in structures called [http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/guidata.html handles], which can not be directly accessed from the workspace. One useful method for debugging is to pass the variables used into the base workspace just before the point where the error occurs. This can be done using the [http://www.mathworks.nl/help/matlab/ref/assignin.html assignin] function:
{{{
assignin('base', 'name_of_variable_in_base_workspace', handles.name_of_variable_in_GUI)
}}}
